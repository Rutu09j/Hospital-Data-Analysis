# Hospital-Data-Analysis
Analyzed hospital data to uncover insights on patient demographics, treatment trends, and departmental performance to support data-driven healthcare decisions.
Hospital Data Analysis Project

📌 Project Overview

This project involves analyzing hospital data to gain insights into patient demographics, treatment patterns, admission trends, and departmental performance. The aim is to support healthcare providers in making informed decisions to enhance patient care and optimize hospital operations.

📊 Objectives

Understand patient distribution by age, gender, and medical condition.

Analyze department-wise admission and discharge trends.

Evaluate treatment effectiveness and hospital stay duration.

Identify peak admission periods and resource utilization.

🛠 Tools & Technologies
Tools Used: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) 

Platform:  Jupyter Notebook 

📈 Key Insights

Majority of patients were in the 40–60 age group, with a higher admission rate in the cardiology department.

Peak admission periods occurred in winter months, especially for respiratory cases.

Certain departments showed high patient readmission rates, signaling scope for care improvement.
